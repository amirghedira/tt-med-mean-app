# Overview 

 This app contains three roles, an admin (webmaster) that adds doctors and nurses, and agents.
Doctors are granted access by an admin to perform a consultation and check for the agent's medical file. They can also generate certificates for their agents and download them as a pdf document then print it. The data of the agent is dynamically injected into the certificates.
The nurse provides consultations to the agents so the doctors can be able to see them and schedule them, and they also mark the presence of a doctor each day.
